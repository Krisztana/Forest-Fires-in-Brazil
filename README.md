## Forest Fires in Brazil

This repository focuses on the analysis of forest fires in Brazil, with ongoing work being conducted on this project.

**Challenge Description**

Forest fires pose a significant threat to the preservation of tropical forests. Understanding the frequency of fires over time is crucial for taking preventive measures. Brazil, home to the largest rainforest on the planet, requires particular attention in this regard.

**Dataset**

The dataset utilized in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and sourced from the official website of the [Brazilian government](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/sistema-nacional-de-informacoes-florestais-snif). It comprises reports detailing the number of forest fires in Brazil, categorized by states, spanning from 1998 to 2017.

The dataset includes the following files:

Brazil_forestfires_EDA: This file encompasses data exploration and visualization of the forest fire dataset.

Brazil_forestfires_map: An interactive choropleth map displays the number of fires by region. By selecting a specific year, the map showcases the total number of fires recorded in each region during that year.

**Tools and Libraries**

In this project, I utilized GeoPandas and the Bokeh library to create the interactive choropleth map, which aids in visualising and understanding the forest fire data.

**Conclusion**

The Forest Fires in Brazil project aims to shed light on the alarming issue of forest fires and their impact on tropical forests. By leveraging the dataset, conducting exploratory analysis, and visualizing the data through an interactive map, this project strives to raise awareness and contribute to understanding the problem's magnitude.
