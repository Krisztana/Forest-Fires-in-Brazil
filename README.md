## Forest Fires in Brazil

I am still working on this project.

### Challenge description

Forest fires are very serious problem for the preservation of the Tropical Forests. Understanding the frequency of the fires in a time series can help to take action to prevent them.
Brazil has the largest rainforest on the planet.

### Dataset

The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it was obtained from the official website of the [Brazilian government](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/sistema-nacional-de-informacoes-florestais-snif).

It includes the reports of the number of forest fires in Brazil divided by states from 1998 to 2017.

It includes:

* Brazil_forestfires_EDA - data exploration and visualization

* Brazil_forestfires_map - an interactive choropleth map with the number of fires data, by choosing a year the map will show the total number of fires in each region in that year

I used GeoPandas and the Bokeh library to create the map.
